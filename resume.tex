\section{Research}
\subsection{Buddythreads: Scheduler-Base Side Channel Defenses}
A modification to the Linux kernel that allows a process to request that it
should always be scheduled simultaneously with another, ``buddy'' thread.
This allows the buddy thread to make noise on shared resources that may be used
for side channel attacks.
I also developed and evaluated several methods for creating noise on these
shared resources and showed that perfect information of the victim's leakage is
sufficient to thwart attacks.

Submitted to ISCA 2016.

\subsection{Bubbles Secure Sharing System}
\noindent
A prototype security system that refactors the sharing out of mobile and web 
applications and makes it secure.
Sharing is then done on a `Bubble' level, where information is grouped by the
user into a single package, or folder,  that may be shared.
Design principles of the system include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Principal of Least surprise: minimize changes to the programming environment of the developer
  \item
    Interface integration between the application running in the Bubbles system and the system itself
  \item
    Lightweight: The containers that provide the security for the Bubbles system
    should have minimal performance impact
\end{itemize}
