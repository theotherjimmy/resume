\section{Profile}
\noindent
I am a UT-trained Electrical Engineer, and am widely considered a Jedi-Master programmer by my peers.
I have designed the entire stack for computers from computers from transistors and computer architecture to operating systems and application level software. 
I have performed significant work in all development phases of a project life cycle.
In addition to computers, I also have experience with interfacing to reality via DSP.
I am clearly passionate about Electrical Engineering as many of my hobbies are related to programming, embedded systems, and automation.
